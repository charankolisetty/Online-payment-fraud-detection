In the realm of online payment security, the utilization of machine learning, and specifically Random Forest algorithms, has emerged as a powerful tool for fraud detection. This paper delves into the development and implementation of a Random Forest-based system to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting fraudulent activities in online transactions.

The Random Forest model is trained on a diverse set of features, encompassing transaction amounts, timestamps, geographical information, device characteristics, and user behavior. Through the ensemble nature of Random Forest, the model combines the strength of multiple decision trees to effectively identify patterns associated with legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Real-time monitoring is employed, allowing the system to analyze transactions as they occur, enabling swift responses to potential fraud. Continuous learning mechanisms ensure the model remains adaptive to evolving fraud tactics, enhancing its resilience over time.

This study emphasizes the interpretability of the Random Forest model, providing insights into the features that contribute to its decision-making process. By offering transparency, the system addresses regulatory compliance requirements and instills user confidence in the fraud detection process.

Through experiments and evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Random Forest-based approach in achieving high accuracy and reliability in online payment fraud detection. This research contributes to the advancement of secure online payment systems by leveraging the strengths of Random Forest algorithms for robust fraud mitigation.
